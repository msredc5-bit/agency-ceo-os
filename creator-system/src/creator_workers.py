"""Creator Studio workers — Content Creation, Media & Entertainment.

Built on the boss-ceo engine (WorkerBase): same CEO + gate pattern as
Talvenor, new workers for creators. Flow, exactly as Boss described:

  CEO decision -> topic research -> script -> visual plan
  -> caption/hashtags -> publish prep (GATE) -> performance report

Mock mode: workers plan and draft through the model. Nothing publishes,
sends, or spends from here. PublishPrep output always carries
gate='post it' (video: 'upload it') and waits for the owner's word.
Rules baked into every brief: no invented stats, clients, or results;
no copyrighted music, characters, or copied work; no real person's
face/voice imitation.
